 There is no Chronicle app.  It is a structural description of 3 apps.
  - journal
  - logs
  - topicals
<p>
All 3 apps look similar but are used for different purposes and there fore have similar overall structures each with minor differences.

<p>
The journal is designed for stream of consciousness writing.  There is a singular journal.
<br> Logs are designed to keep track interactions between the user and other parties.  The other party may be a person or a group (ie. company, organization, etc.
Thus there are several individual logs for each other party.
<br> Topicals are designed to keep track of the users activities based on categories (ie. diet, exercise, etc.)

<p>
Journal is comprised of "detail" sections.  
<br>
The side bar for Journal  uses keywords and people assigned in each section to filter the main display
<p>
Logs are also comprised of sections... but each section is broken into 2 parts. The "detail segment" and a corresponding "meta" segment.   The meta segment is meant to hold related info for a section - like names, or phone numbers.
